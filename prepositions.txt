Many people today are worried about drugs. It seems that more and more people are getting addicted to dangerous substances, such as heroine , crack and cocaine. This damages their health. But what leads to people becoming drug addicts? Why do people inject drugs into their veins? In some cases it is the inability to cope with problems they may have in their everyday lives.

When we complain about the problems that hard drugs cause, we need to remember that people suffer from all kinds of health problems caused by legal substances , like alcohol and cigarettes. We would all benefit from more education and the government should attempt to make sure that we know all the risks involved.

I am very fond of my husband, Harry. I have been married to him for over 30 years now. He still cares about me just as much as when we first met ages ago, when I had got lost and I asked him for directions. He was so kind to me and offered to drive me to wherever I had to go. It was love at first sight and since that time my relationship with him has been wonderful.

Harry is proud of me because I have been so successful in my job as an artist. He has never been jealous of my fame. I really adore him for supporting me so much. Every evening we chat with each other about the day's events. We do argue sometimes , like other couples, too. But whenever I have an argument with him, we start laughing after a short period of time and both apologize to each other for getting so angry. I simply can't imagine life without him.

My younger sisters, Mary and Julie , are identical twins. Although they are very similar to each other in many ways, they differ in other ways. They agree on many things; for example they are both fond of pets so they have a lot to talk about. When they first went to school our mum and dad insisted on them being put in different classes. Mary is now good at gymnastics and art but Julie is hopeless at anything practical. Mary knows a lot about history and geography but is not interested in sport. Her teachers say Julie is probably going to succeed in something artistic like painting, whereas Mary will probably end up doing some kind of research work.
